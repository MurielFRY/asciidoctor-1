== Requirements

For using plantuml you have to install link:http://www.graphviz.org/download/[Graphviz]

== How to generate documentation files


.Ho to start

|command |description

a|
----
mvn

----
cd asciidoctor-pdf
mvn
----
|the default phase "generate-resources" will be executed for one submodules

a|
----
mvn clean generate-resources
----
|the target folder will be removed and the default phase "generate-resources" for all modules will be executed for all submodules

a|
----
cd asciidoctor-pdf
mvn clean generate-resources
----
|the target folder will be removed and the default phase "generate-resources" for this submodules will be executed for all submodules

a|
----
cd asciidoctor-pdf
mvn clean package
----
|the target folder will be removed and the doc will be generated and the source code compiled and packaged for all submodules. Use Apache Shade for including the dependencies in the jar and creating the manifest-file.

TIP: cleaning the target folder is always a good idea

== Showing PlantUML diagrams on GitHub

Usually, PlantUML diagrams are not rendered on Github repository overviews. However
there is a neat workaround involving PlantUML-render-servers to make diagrams visible.

Step 1: Store your diagram in a separate file:

For example contents of assets/example.iuml:
[source,asciidoc]
----
@startuml
Class01 <|-- Class02
Class03 *-- Class04
Class05 o-- Class06
Class07 .. Class08
Class09 -- Class10
@enduml
----


On your desktop, graphviz usually renders PlantUML diagrams, but in browsers, this
does not work.

To get around this, PlantUML provides instructions on how to host a server which turns
a .iuml file into an image which can be displayed.

Luckily for us, there are a lot of publicly available servers to render your diagrams.
For instance, the official PlantUML server at http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/

Step 2: Embedding an Image

In combination with raw.githubusercontent.com we can now feed the server the diagram file
to render our image for us.

For example, the source of assets/example.iuml would be:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxwahl/asciidoctor/master/assets/example.iuml

Now we embed the image with the following line:
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxwahl/asciidoctor/master/assets/example.iuml[Example]
----

This results in:

image::http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxwahl/asciidoctor/master/assets/example.iuml[Example]
